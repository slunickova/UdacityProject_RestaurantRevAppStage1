# Restaurant Reviews app - stage 1

## Project Overview
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Live preview
You can see a preview of the game on a page below:

## Contributing
This repository is the project made as a part of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program by Udacity. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
